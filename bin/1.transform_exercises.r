## 1.1. COUNTS

# a) How can you use count() to count the number of rows with a missing value
# for a given variable?
  
# b) Expand the following calls to count() to instead use group_by(),
# summarize(), and arrange():
#    1. flights |> count(dest, sort = TRUE)

#    2. flights |> count(tailnum, wt = distance)

## 1.2. NUMERIC TRANSFORMATION

# a) Explain in words what each line of the following code does:
#flights |> 
#  group_by(hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100) |> 
#  summarize(prop_cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_time)), n = n()) |> 
#  filter(hour > 1) |> 
#  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = prop_cancelled)) +
#  geom_line(color = "grey50") + 
#  geom_point(aes(size = n))

# b) Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard
# to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. You can see the
# basic problem by running the code below: there’s a gap between each hour.
#    flights |> 
#      filter(month == 1, day == 1, !is.na(dep_delay)) |> 
#      ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +
#      geom_point()
#    Convert them to a more truthful representation of time (either fractional
# hours or minutes since midnight).
  
# c) Round dep_time and arr_time to the nearest five minutes

## 1.3. GENERAL TRANSFORMATION

# a) Find the 12 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want
# to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().
  
# b) Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

# c) At which hour should you fly if you want to avoid more than one hour delays
# as much as possible?
  
# d) What does flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number() < 4) do? What
# does flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number(dep_delay) < 4) do?
 
# e) For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight,
# compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

# f) Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that
# caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow
# earlier flights to leave. Using lag(), explore how the average flight delay
# for an hour is related to the average delay for the previous hour.
#   flights |> 
#     mutate(hour = dep_time %/% 100) |> 
#     group_by(year, month, day, hour) |> 
#     summarize(
#       dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
#       n = n(),
#       .groups = "drop"
#     ) |> 
#     filter(n > 5)

# g) Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast 
# (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error)? Compute the air 
# time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which
# flights were most delayed in the air?
  
# h) Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use those
# destinations to come up with a relative ranking of the carriers based on their
# performance for the same destination.

# 2. FACTORES
{
library("tidyverse")

# 2.1. BASICS
#[no exercises]

# 2.2. DATASET gss_cat

# a) Explore the distribution of rincome (reported income). What makes the
# default bar chart hard to understand? How could you improve the plot?
  
# b) What is the most common religion in this survey? What’s the most common
# political party?

# c) Which religion does denomination (denom) apply to? How can you find out
# with a table? How can you find out with a visualization?
  
# 2.3. MODIFYING FACTOR ORDER

# a) For each factor in gss_cat identify whether the order of the levels is
# arbitrary or principled.
  
# b) Why did moving “Not applicable” to the front of the levels move it to the
# bottom of the plot?

# 2.4. MODIFYING FACTOR LEVEL

# a) How have the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and
# Independent changed over time?
    
# b) How could you collapse rincome into a small set of categories?
  
# c) Notice there are 9 groups (excluding other) in the fct_lump example above.
# Why not 10? (Hint: type ?fct_lump, and find the default for the argument
# other_level is “Other”.)

}
# 3. LOGICAL VECTORS
{
library("nycflights13")
library("tidyverse")

# 3.1. Comparison

# a) How does dplyr::near() work? Type near to see the source code. 
# Is sqrt(2)^2 near 2?

# b) Use mutate(), is.na(), and count() together to describe how the missing
# values in dep_time, sched_dep_time and dep_delay are connected.
  
# 3.2. Boolean algebra

# a) Find all flights where arr_delay is missing but dep_delay is not. Find all
# flights where neither arr_time nor sched_arr_time are missing, but arr_delay
# is.
  
# b) How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing 
#in these rows? What might these rows represent?

# c) Assuming that a missing dep_time implies that a flight is cancelled, look
# at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is there a 
# connection between the proportion of cancelled flights and the average delay
# of non-cancelled flights?

# 3.3. Summaries

# a) What will sum(is.na(x)) tell you? How about mean(is.na(x))?

# b) What does prod() return when applied to a logical vector? What logical
# summary function is it equivalent to? What does max() return when applied to a
# logical vector? What logical summary function is it equivalent to? Read the
# documentation and perform a few experiments.

# 3.4. Conditional transformations

# a) A number is even if it’s divisible by two, which in R you can find out with
# x %% 2 == 0. Use this fact and if_else() to determine whether each number
# between 0 and 20 is even or odd.

# b) Given a vector of days like x <- c("Monday", "Saturday", "Wednesday"), use
# an if_else() statement to label them as weekends or weekdays.

# c) Use if_else() to compute the absolute value of a numeric vector called x.

# d) Write a case_when() statement that uses the month and day columns from
# flights to label a selection of important US holidays (e.g., New Years Day,
# 4th of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). First create a logical column that
# is either TRUE or FALSE, and then create a character column that either gives
# the name of the holiday or is NA.
